# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Data Source Connector Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the base interface for all data source connectors.
# Details:
In SmartInsight.Knowledge project:
1. Create IDataSourceConnector interface with methods for:
   - Configuration
   - Validation
   - Extraction
   - Transformation
2. Define connector lifecycle events
3. Create connector registration system
4. Implement connector factory
5. Define connector metadata attributes

Ensure interface supports all required connector types.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with mock implementations. Verify factory correctly instantiates connectors. Test lifecycle events.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define IDataSourceConnector Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core interface definition with essential methods for data source connectivity
### Details:
Define the IDataSourceConnector interface with methods for connection, validation, data extraction, and transformation. Include method signatures for Connect(), Validate(), Extract(), and Transform() with appropriate parameters and return types.

## 2. Implement Connection Configuration Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Design data structures for connector configuration and credentials management
### Details:
Create configuration classes that will be used by connectors to store connection parameters, credentials, and other settings. Implement serialization/deserialization support and secure credential storage mechanisms.

## 3. Design Connector Lifecycle Events [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement event system for connector initialization, execution, and termination
### Details:
Define lifecycle events such as OnInitialize, OnConnect, OnExecute, OnDisconnect, and OnError. Create an event subscription mechanism allowing the system to monitor connector state changes and respond appropriately.

## 4. Create Connector Registration System [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.3
### Description: Build a registry for managing available connector implementations
### Details:
Implement a connector registry that allows dynamic registration and discovery of connector implementations. Include methods for registering, unregistering, and querying available connectors.

## 5. Implement Connector Factory [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.4
### Description: Create factory pattern implementation for instantiating connectors
### Details:
Design and implement a factory class that can create instances of specific connector implementations based on type or identifier. Include dependency injection support and configuration parameter handling.

## 6. Define Connector Metadata Attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create attribute system for connector discovery and documentation
### Details:
Design attribute classes for annotating connector implementations with metadata such as name, description, version, supported data formats, and configuration requirements. Implement reflection-based discovery of these attributes.

## 7. Implement Connector Documentation Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.6
### Description: Create system for auto-generating connector documentation
### Details:
Build a documentation generator that can extract connector metadata and produce human-readable documentation. Include support for generating markdown, HTML, or other documentation formats from connector attributes.

## 8. Create Sample Connector Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.5, 14.6
### Description: Develop a reference implementation of the connector interface
### Details:
Implement a sample connector that demonstrates proper implementation of the interface, lifecycle events, configuration handling, and metadata attributes. This will serve as a reference for developers creating new connectors.
