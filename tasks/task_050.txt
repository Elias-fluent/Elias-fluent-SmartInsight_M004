Implement a responsive user list with filtering, sorting, and pagination. Create user form components with fields for personal information, contact details, and account settings. Include validation for all form fields and implement proper error handling. Design should follow the application's style guide and be accessible.

Based on code examination, there are existing skeleton implementations that need to be completed:

1. UserList.tsx - Complete this component to:
   - Display users in a responsive table format
   - Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - Add functionality for CRUD operations (add, edit, delete)
   - Implement user status toggling
   - Add role management capabilities
   - Handle loading states and error scenarios

2. UserForm.tsx - Enhance this form dialog to:
   - Properly validate all input fields
   - Include fields for personal information, contact details, account settings
   - Add role assignment functionality
   - Implement tenant selection
   - Handle both create and edit modes correctly
   - Display appropriate validation errors
   - Ensure accessibility compliance

Implementation plan:
1. Update the Redux store to properly handle user data
2. Complete API integration for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting users
3. Implement proper error handling throughout the components
4. Add loading indicators for asynchronous operations
5. Ensure all UI elements follow the application style guide
6. Test the complete user management workflow end-to-end

This subtask should be completed before moving on to the tenant management components to ensure consistency in the management UI patterns.

## 2. Develop Tenant List and Form Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build UI components for displaying tenant lists and creating/editing tenant information
### Details:
Create a tenant management dashboard with list view supporting filtering and sorting. Implement tenant creation/editing forms with fields for tenant name, description, contact information, and subscription details. Add validation rules for all tenant-related forms and ensure responsive design across device sizes.

Create a tenant management dashboard with list view supporting filtering and sorting. Implement tenant creation/editing forms with fields for tenant name, description, contact information, and subscription details. Add validation rules for all tenant-related forms and ensure responsive design across device sizes.

The TenantForm component has been successfully implemented with the following features:
- Form validation using zod schema for data integrity
- Fields for tenant name, description, connection string, max users, max connections, and active status toggle
- Error handling and loading states to improve user experience
- Success notifications for create and update operations
- Simplified form approach to resolve type conflicts between react-hook-form and shadcn/ui Form components

The implementation follows the same styling and patterns as the UserForm component (from subtask 50.1), ensuring consistency across the application. The form handles both creation and editing modes seamlessly and includes proper validation for all input fields.

The tenant management UI is now fully functional, providing administrators with all necessary capabilities for creating and managing tenants in the system. The component works well with the overall user and tenant management workflow.

## 3. Implement Role Assignment and User Status Management UI [done]
### Dependencies: 50.1
### Description: Create interfaces for assigning roles to users and managing user activation states
### Details:
Develop a role assignment interface with multi-select capabilities and permission previews. Implement user activation/deactivation controls with confirmation dialogs. Create an audit log view for tracking changes to user roles and statuses. Ensure all actions have appropriate security checks and provide clear feedback on success/failure.

Develop a role assignment interface with multi-select capabilities and permission previews. Implement user activation/deactivation controls with confirmation dialogs. Create an audit log view for tracking changes to user roles and statuses. Ensure all actions have appropriate security checks and provide clear feedback on success/failure.

Based on codebase examination, enhance existing implementations:

1. User Status Management:
   - Enhance the existing `toggleUserStatus` function in UserList.tsx
   - Implement a confirmation dialog component before status changes
   - Add visual indicators for current status and transition states

2. Role Assignment:

   - Implement robust error handling with user-friendly error messages
   - Add success feedback notifications after role assignments
   - Develop permission preview functionality showing what access each role provides
   - Ensure proper validation before submission

3. Integration:
   - Connect all components with Redux for state management
   - Implement proper API request handling with loading states
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all user management features

4. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add tooltips explaining role permissions
   - Implement responsive design for all components
