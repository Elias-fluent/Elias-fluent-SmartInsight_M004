# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Knowledge Graph Creation Pipeline
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 14, 15, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create pipeline for building knowledge graph from ingested data.
# Details:
In SmartInsight.Knowledge project:
1. Implement KnowledgeGraphBuilder class
2. Create entity extraction pipeline
3. Implement relation mapping logic
4. Add triple-store based implementation (Subject-Predicate-Object)
5. Create hierarchical taxonomy with inheritance and composition
6. Implement versioning for temporal knowledge evolution
7. Add provenance tracking to source documents and data sources

Ensure knowledge graph respects tenant boundaries.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for entity extraction and relation mapping. Test knowledge graph building with sample data. Verify provenance tracking works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Entity Extraction Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the overall architecture for entity extraction including NLP components, processing flow, and integration points.
### Details:
Create architectural diagrams showing data flow, component interactions, and system boundaries. Include specifications for input/output formats, error handling, and scalability considerations.

## 2. Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) Module [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop the core NER module to identify and extract entities from text documents.
### Details:
Select and implement appropriate NLP libraries/models for entity extraction. Include custom entity types relevant to the domain. Ensure proper text preprocessing and post-processing for accuracy.

## 3. Create Entity Disambiguation System [done]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Build a system to disambiguate entities and resolve coreferences across documents.
### Details:
Implement algorithms for entity resolution, coreference resolution, and contextual disambiguation. Create a confidence scoring mechanism for entity matches.

## 4. Design Relation Extraction Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Design the framework for identifying and extracting relationships between entities.
### Details:
Define relation types, extraction methods, and validation rules. Include both explicit and implicit relation detection strategies.

## 5. Implement Triple-Store Database [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Set up and configure the triple-store database for storing knowledge graph data.
### Details:
Select appropriate triple-store technology, design schema, and implement CRUD operations. Configure for performance, considering query patterns and data volume.

## 6. Develop Relation Mapping Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 21.4, 21.5
### Description: Build the pipeline to extract and map relationships into the triple-store format.
### Details:
Create transformers to convert extracted relations to RDF triples. Implement validation rules and consistency checks for relation mapping.

## 7. Design Hierarchical Taxonomy Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 21.5
### Description: Design the hierarchical taxonomy structure with inheritance capabilities.
### Details:
Define class hierarchies, inheritance rules, and ontological relationships. Create visualization tools for taxonomy exploration.

## 8. Implement Taxonomy Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 21.7
### Description: Build the system to manage and maintain the hierarchical taxonomy.
### Details:
Develop APIs for taxonomy creation, modification, and querying. Implement inheritance resolution algorithms and consistency validation.

## 9. Design Knowledge Graph Versioning System [done]
### Dependencies: 21.6
### Description: Design the versioning system to track temporal evolution of the knowledge graph.
### Details:
Define versioning strategy, temporal data model, and change tracking mechanisms. Include specifications for querying historical states.

## 10. Implement Versioning and Temporal Query Support [done]
### Dependencies: 21.9
### Description: Implement the versioning system and temporal query capabilities.
### Details:
Develop version control mechanisms, temporal indexing, and query interfaces for accessing historical knowledge states.

## 11. Design Provenance Tracking Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.6
### Description: Design the framework for tracking the provenance of knowledge graph elements.
### Details:
Define provenance metadata schema, source document linking strategy, and confidence scoring approach.

## 12. Implement Provenance Integration and Querying [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.11, 21.10, 21.8
### Description: Implement the provenance tracking system and integrate with the knowledge graph pipeline.
### Details:
Develop provenance capture mechanisms, source document indexing, and provenance-aware query interfaces. Create visualization tools for provenance exploration.
