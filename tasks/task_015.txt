# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement PostgreSQL Connector
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Create connector implementation for PostgreSQL data sources.
# Details:
In SmartInsight.Knowledge project:
1. Implement PostgreSQLConnector class
2. Create connection string builder and validator
3. Implement schema discovery
4. Add query execution logic
5. Create data transformation pipeline
6. Implement incremental update detection
7. Add error handling and logging

Ensure secure handling of connection credentials.

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests with test PostgreSQL instance. Verify connection, extraction, and transformation. Test incremental updates with changed data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design PostgreSQL Connection Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a connection interface that handles authentication, connection pooling, and security for PostgreSQL databases.
### Details:
Define connection parameters (host, port, database, user, password), implement connection pooling for performance, add SSL support, and create connection validation methods.

## 2. Implement Connection Validation and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop methods to validate and test PostgreSQL connections with proper error handling.
### Details:
Create connection test utilities, implement timeout handling, develop connection health checks, and add detailed error reporting for connection issues.

## 3. Build Schema Discovery Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create functionality to discover and map PostgreSQL database schemas, tables, and columns.
### Details:
Query PostgreSQL system tables to extract schema information, handle various PostgreSQL data types, support views and materialized views, and implement schema caching for performance.

## 4. Develop Query Builder and Executor [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.3
### Description: Implement a query builder and execution engine for PostgreSQL-specific SQL syntax.
### Details:
Support standard CRUD operations, implement parameterized queries for security, handle PostgreSQL-specific query features, and optimize query performance.

## 5. Create Data Type Transformation Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Build a transformation layer to convert between PostgreSQL data types and application data types.
### Details:
Map PostgreSQL types to appropriate application types, handle special types (JSON, arrays, etc.), implement custom type converters, and ensure proper handling of NULL values.

## 6. Implement Data Extraction Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Develop a pipeline for efficiently extracting large datasets from PostgreSQL.
### Details:
Implement cursor-based extraction for large datasets, add batching capabilities, optimize memory usage during extraction, and add progress tracking.

## 7. Build Incremental Update Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.6
### Description: Create mechanisms to detect and extract only changed data since the last extraction.
### Details:
Implement timestamp-based change detection, support WAL (Write-Ahead Log) based change tracking, add support for custom change tracking columns, and create checkpoint management.

## 8. Develop Comprehensive Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.4, 15.6, 15.7
### Description: Implement robust error handling throughout the connector with detailed error messages and recovery strategies.
### Details:
Create custom exception types, implement retry mechanisms with backoff, add detailed logging, and develop recovery strategies for common failure scenarios.

## 9. Implement Transaction Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Add support for transaction management to ensure data consistency during operations.
### Details:
Support explicit transaction control, implement savepoints, add transaction isolation level configuration, and ensure proper cleanup of transactions.

## 10. Create Comprehensive Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9
### Description: Develop a testing suite covering all connector functionality with unit and integration tests.
### Details:
Create unit tests for each component, develop integration tests with actual PostgreSQL instances, implement performance benchmarks, and add test coverage reporting.
