# SmartInsight Architecture Overview

## Introduction

SmartInsight is an intelligent data analytics platform that leverages AI to provide actionable insights from various data sources. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the SmartInsight architecture, its components, interactions, and design principles.

## System Architecture

SmartInsight follows a modular, microservices-inspired architecture that separates concerns into distinct components. The high-level architecture consists of the following main components:

### Core Components

1. **SmartInsight.API** - The main entry point for client applications, providing RESTful endpoints for all system functionality.
2. **SmartInsight.Admin** - Administrative interface for system configuration and management.
3. **SmartInsight.AI** - Contains AI and machine learning capabilities for data analysis and insight generation.
4. **SmartInsight.Core** - Core domain models, interfaces, and shared functionality.
5. **SmartInsight.Data** - Data access and persistence layer.
6. **SmartInsight.History** - Tracking and management of historical data and user interactions.
7. **SmartInsight.Knowledge** - Knowledge base and vector database management for AI operations.
8. **SmartInsight.Telemetry** - Logging, monitoring, and telemetry functionality.
9. **SmartInsight.UI** - Front-end user interface built with modern web technologies.

### Architectural Layers

The system is organized into the following architectural layers:

1. **Presentation Layer** - UI components and API controllers for handling user interactions.
2. **Application Layer** - Application services, workflows, and business logic coordination.
3. **Domain Layer** - Core business logic, domain models, and business rules.
4. **Infrastructure Layer** - Technical capabilities (data access, messaging, logging, etc.).
5. **Cross-cutting Concerns** - Services that span multiple layers (security, logging, caching).

## Design Principles

SmartInsight's architecture adheres to the following design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has a clear, well-defined responsibility.
2. **Dependency Inversion** - High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.
3. **Single Responsibility** - Each class has a single responsibility, increasing maintainability and testability.
4. **Interface Segregation** - Components expose only what clients need through focused interfaces.
5. **Domain-Driven Design** - The architecture is organized around the business domain rather than technical concerns.
6. **Clean Architecture** - Dependencies point inward, with the domain layer at the center.
7. **Testability** - The architecture facilitates comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Qdrant for vector storage
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Redux, TailwindCSS
- **AI/ML**: Custom AI models, LLM integrations, vector embeddings
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Monitoring**: Serilog, Application Insights, custom telemetry

## Key Interactions

The following describes some of the key interactions between components:

1. **Client Request Flow**:
   - User requests flow through the UI → API → Application Services → Domain Services → Data Access → Database
   - Responses flow back up through the same layers

2. **AI Processing Flow**:
   - Data is collected from sources → processed by data pipelines → stored in databases
   - AI models analyze data → generate insights → store results → expose via API

3. **Analytics Flow**:
   - User queries → API processes request → retrieves data → applies AI analysis → returns insights

4. **Security Flow**:
   - Authentication requests → validated by identity provider → generates tokens
   - Subsequent requests include token → API validates → authorizes → processes
